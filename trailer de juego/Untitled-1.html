              <h2>Gameplay</h2>
              <p>
                Monster Hunter: World is an action role-playing video game, set in an open world environment, and played from a third-person perspective. As in previous games in the series, the player takes the role of a "Hunter" who is tasked by the "Commission of Inquiry", to pursue and kill (or capture) large monsters, which wander outside of their Astera central base for them to study. The player character does not have any intrinsic attributes, but is instead determined by the equipment the character is equipped with.

              </p>
              <p> This includes a weapon that comes from one of the fourteen archetypes (such as longsword, bow, or hammer), which then defines the types of combat moves and skills the player can benefit from. The player can also equip himself with armor (ornaments can be added to this equipment, which are objects that provide different abilities) that have benefits or base abilities and that can be enhanced with decorations and ciguas, which are equipment elements with the same function. of the decorations except that it is only possible to equip one cigua at a time. While some basic equipment can be purchased with in-game currency, most equipment is built from materials obtained by killing or catching monsters, in rewards for completing quests, or items collected in the field. This creates a central loop of gameplay that the player has to fight monsters they can defeat, to obtain the correct loot to create upgraded weapons and armor to allow them to take on more powerful monsters, and the ability to have a team. Even better.
